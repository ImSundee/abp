# abp - beta
 A better poop

 Poop done better? Hopefully.

Yes this is beta its at your own risk


This is a Gantry mounted poop device for filament changing/purging


 ## Print settings:

All parts will print on 0.4 or 0.6 mm nozzle.
Stiff material is required - ASA CF is good - PPS CF is better.
3 walls + top/bottom is perfect.

Your printer needs to be tuned. If you havn't already I recommend using: https://vector3d.shop/products/califlower-calibration-tool-mk2
