 ## Print settings:

All parts will print on 0.4 or 0.6 mm nozzle.
Stiff material is required - ASA CF is good - PPS CF is better.
3 walls + top/bottom is perfect.

Your printer needs to be tuned. If you havn't already I recommend using: https://vector3d.shop/products/califlower-calibration-tool-mk2

## Parts to print from AT_Brush

This mod utilized the sweet design by AT. You will want to print all of the model apart from a "brush mount" and "[a]_front_arm_slide.stl" as ABP ones will replace them.

## Triming the gear rack
Ensuring you trim the rack is critical so the parts line up correctly
